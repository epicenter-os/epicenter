[profile.dev]
incremental = true # Compile your binary in smaller steps.

[profile.release]
# The following optimizations are disabled due to CoreAudio FFI crashes on macOS.
# These aggressive optimizations can cause segmentation faults when CPAL interfaces
# with CoreAudio, resulting in null pointer dereferences in HALDeviceList::GetData.
# 
# We may re-enable these in the future when:
# - CPAL fixes the underlying FFI safety issues
# - Rust's optimization passes better handle FFI boundaries
# - We implement our own audio backend that doesn't rely on CPAL
#
# For more information on Tauri app size optimization, see:
# https://v2.tauri.app/concept/size/
#
# codegen-units = 1 # Allows LLVM to perform better optimization.
# lto = true # Enables link-time-optimizations.
# opt-level = "s" # Prioritizes small binary size. Use `3` if you prefer speed.
panic = "abort" # Higher performance by disabling panic handlers.
strip = true # Ensures debug symbols are removed.
